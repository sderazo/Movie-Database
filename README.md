# Movie-Database
On a team of 4, we constructed a program that sorts and searches for movies in a database.
I developed the user interface by writing search managers based on IMDb codes and movie titles and the display manager 
to list all movie data sorted by movie title. 
I also composed an undo delete function.

Language utilized: C++
